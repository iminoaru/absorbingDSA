works on the principle of : find the smallest element and swap it with the first element, 
now find the second smallest element and swap it with the second element of the array and so on.


ADVANTAGES :-
  - Simple and easy to understand.
  - Works well with small datasets.

DISADVANTAGES :-
  - Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst and average case.
  - Does not work well on large datasets.
  - Does not preserve the relative order of items with equal keys which means it is not stable.
